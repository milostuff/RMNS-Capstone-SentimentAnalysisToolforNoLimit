Overview of the files:

1. MAIN
These are the final implementations of models to the dashboard of NoLimit
* apitest_Distilbert = API test for the Distilbert model
* apitest_Longformer = API test for the Longformer model
* apitest_XLNet = API test for the XLNet Model
* apitest_nomodel = API test without using a model to configure connection and proper retrieval of data

2. TESTING-RACHEL
These are the code to train and validate the Longformer model
* longformer = Training and testing for the 1st longformer model iteration on the complete (combined) dataset
* longformer2 = Training and testing for the 2nd longformer model iteration on the complete dataset
* longformer3 = Training and testing for the 3rd longformer model iteration on the complete dataset
* longformer4 = Training and testing for the 4th longformer model iteration on the complete dataset
* longformer5 = Training and testing for the 5th longformer model iteration on the complete dataset
* longformer6 = Training and testing for the 6th longformer model iteration on the complete dataset
* longformer7 = Training and testing for the 7th longformer model iteration on the complete dataset
* longformer8 = Training and testing for the 8th longformer model iteration on the complete dataset
   
4. TESTING-MILO
These are the code to train and validate the DistilBERT and XLNet model
* DistilBert = Training and testing for the DistilBERT model on the incomplete (uncombined) dataset
* distilbert2 = Training and testing for the 1st DistilBERT model iteration on the complete dataset
* distilbert3 = Training and testing for the 2nd DistilBERT model iteration on the complete dataset
* distilbert4 = Training and testing for the 3rd DistilBERT model iteration on the complete dataset
* distilbert5 = Training and testing for the 4th DistilBERT model iteration on the complete dataset
* distilbert6 = Training and testing for the 5th DistilBERT model iteration on the complete dataset
* xlnet2 = Training and testing for the 1st XLNet model iteration on the complete dataset
* xlnet3 = Training and testing for the 2nd XLNet model iteration on the complete dataset
